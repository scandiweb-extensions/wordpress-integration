# TemplateExtension

This extension is empty, apart from the Magento2 boilerplate code to register as a valid extension. You can use this boilerplate as a base for your own extension, or just remove it and do it from scratch. Make sure to rename every reference of `TemplateExtension`!

**When you rename the extension, don't forget to update `.env` in the Magento root of the project!**
