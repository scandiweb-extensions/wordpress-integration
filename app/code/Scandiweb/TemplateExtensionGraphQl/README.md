# TemplateExtensionGraphQl

This extension is empty, apart from the Magento2 boilerplate code to register as a valid extension. You can use this boilerplate as a base for your own extension, or just remove it and do it from scratch. Make sure to rename every reference of `TemplateExtensionGraphQl`!

In `etc/module.xml` you will see there is a dependency to `TemplateExtension`, make sure to update that name as well if you update `TemplateExtension`!

**When you rename the extension, don't forget to update `.env` in the Magento root of the project!**
